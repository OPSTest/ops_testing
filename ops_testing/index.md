**Test cases behaviors,description and check points**

Following are the regression automation test cases. You can see the report [here](#report).

|User Behaviors/Area|Description|Check points|
|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|
|[Build/Publish] Create a new branch. Area should cover MSDN,VS,DOCS.|Build triggered automatically, build report, output content should be converted in the testing. Users get notification email after publishing completes.|1. New created branch's content are all published (check the published content/resource/toc (simplify to c/r/t below) number.<br/>2. New published content page can be visited|
|[Build/Publish] User push some changes on existing branch.| Incremental build should be covered in this testing. Users get notification email after publishing completes.|1. New commit build successfully.<br/>2. Changes showed on the content page|
|[Build/Publish] User can trigger manual publishing via OPS portal.|With option of force publishing(without). Users get notification email after publishing completes.|1. Build results should be successful.<br/>2. If it's incremental, then no content should be published.If it's force publish, the c/r/t number should be same with its first publish|
|[Build/Publish] User can trigger manual publishing via OPS portal.|With option of force publishing(with). Users get notification email after publishing completes.|1. Build results should be successful.<br/>2. If it's incremental, then no content should be published.If it's force publish, the c/r/t number should be same with its first publish|
|[Build/Publish] User can delete a protected branch from VSO/GitHub|Once user deletes a protected branch, the corresponding branch page can still be visited. (such as master and live branch)|1. Once user deletes the protected branch, the delete action result should fail with friendly error message. <br/>2. Protected branch pages can still be visited although it's no longer existed in VSO/GitHub. <br/>3. The protected branch should be shown in branch selector dropdown box( verify on page)|
|[Build/Publish] User create pull request to merge changes to master/live branch|This should be BVT. Build triggered automatically, build report, output content, comments, notifications should be converted in the testing.|1. Set PR state in GitHub when the job is initialized. <br/>2. Set PR comment in GitHub when the job completes <br/>3. Set PR state in GitHub when the job completes <br/>4. Email notification is sent - Optional|
|[Build/Publish] User updates an existing pull request|When a PR is updated by new commits in source branch, a new PR validation build will be triggered. Should cover source branch is in same repo or is in forked repo.|same above|
|[Build/Publish] User did changes in configuration:<br/>1.Op.config.json<br/>2. Docfx.json|Configuration change will cause:<br/>1. build behavior change. <br/>2. Show/hide validation <br/>3. Show/Hide component on output page.Detail is in the docs.||
|[Build/Publish] Build report|Should check build files count, resource count, warning/error count, output url, etc.|1. Build/PR will both receive email <br/>2. PR will always see the build status on the PR page <br/>3. PR will see the comments once the PR comment is enable|
|[Build/Publish] I can build PDF when someone pushes changes into the branch or manually triggered from portal||Download the packges and check if all the pdf has generated|
|[Local build] Local build|User runs .openpublishing.build.ps1 in local cloned repository and the script generates build outputs.|1. Pages has been generated under root/_sites folder <br/>2. The build result is OK|
|[Provision] User add locale in existing repo and do provision for this locale.|New repo will be created and provisioned.|Topic reference a topic not in loc repo. Should be fallback to default locale.|
|[Provision] User de-provision the repo|||
|[Provision] User changes docset config|If user changes base path, themes, should check published url/page||
|[Cross-repository] Dependency build|If repoA has dependency on repoB, and the dependency relationship is set. Then if repoB is changed, repoA should also be built.||
|[Cross-repository] Token/code snippets locale fallback behavior||1.If token/code snippets doesn't exist in localized repository but only in fallback repository. <br/>2.The build can still pass The content should be rendered OK except the token/code snippets is same with fallback repository|
|[Cross-repository] include source files from another rep||Similar with the above one|
|[Cross-repository] Syncing between repos|||

## Regression mannual build test cases

 > [!NOTE]
 > The regression mannual build test cases need to testing after PPE and Production deploayment every sprint.

Create a new branch from master on repository https://github.com/openpublishtest/azure-docs-pr. <br/>Step2. â€¦ (no more for this as new branch will always trigger force build and publish)|1.Build result should be same with https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-docs-pr <br/>2. Visit published page on your branch to see if Redering is OK.<br/>3. Compare build time with prod|
|zure cs-cz repository incremental build|Step1. trigger a build (full) on live branch for repository.https://github.com/openpublishtest/azure-docs-pr.cs-cz. <br/>Step2. once the build completed in Step1, trigger another build (incremental) on live branch.|1. Incremental build result should be succeed or succeed with warning.<br/>2. Visit published page on your branch to see if Redering is OK|

Monitor the build time in Step2 (incremental publish).<br/>2. Monitor the build time in Step3 (incremental PR).<br/>3. Monitor the trend of build time to see if there is performance downgrade.<br/>4. Furthermore, monitor the time of each step to see if there is performance downgrade.|
|Invalid token for same warning count|Step1.  create a token with warning for repository https://github.com/openpublishtest/azure-docs-pr.<br/>Step2. trigger a full build (force publish).<br/>Step3. trigger an incremental build.|1. The warning count should be the same.|

Now we have two jobs to running the cases:

* E2E test run on production: Triggered every 30 minutes
* E2E test run on PPE: Triggered every 2 hour
